// =============================================================================
// queries.js — what each chart of the page asks the semantic model, and the filters those
// questions are built from
// =============================================================================
// A query names the model's fields (semantic_model/model.bim): a column as 'table.column',
// a measure by its name, and says how to group, filter and order them, in the words
// semantic/query.js knows (it lists them). It writes the query as DAX, and the compiler
// (packages/dax-sql) the DAX as what the engine runs. A query holds no expression of its own, and the page works no figure out of
// what comes back: a figure is a measure of the model, a total is a `totals` row, a group is
// a column of the model, an order is an `orderBy`. The page draws the rows. A word a query
// does not have is the owner's to add, not the page's.
// `fct_summary` is the generation per unit, with the price of its region on the row,
// `dim_duid` the units, `fct_region` the regions' price and demand. A query that names a
// column of `dim_duid` next to a fact reads the two joined; one that does not reads the fact
// alone (the compiler's doing). A filter on `dim_duid` reaches the regional tables too, as
// the regions those units are in: the model's relationship from dim_duid to dim_region
// filters both ways.
// Rooftop solar is five units of the model (ROOFTOP_<region>, fuel ROOFTOP): every filter on
// the units reaches it, and no query adds it on its own.
// What a date range reads: the 5-minute tables up to 30 days, the daily ones beyond (they
// hold the whole days: the day still filling is in the 5-minute tables only). A query does
// not name the table: a measure picks it, as the model says (its "Reads 5 minutes"): the
// 5-minute one when the query filters or groups by the fact's own columns, the daily one when
// it goes through the dimensions. So `fact`, `unit` and `price` (grain()) are the tables
// whose date (and time), DUID and region a query uses at this grain: the fact's up to 30
// days, the dimensions' beyond, cut to the days the daily tables hold (wholeDays). Which
// measure a chart draws at a grain is the chart's choice, as a report visual's is: MW at a
// time, MWh a day (`output`, `charging`, `demand`).
// Raw columns are read only as the rows they are, never added up: the Flows rows (a unit's
// MW, a link's flow and limits, for the bubbles and the small charts) and the lists.
//
// createQueries(page) takes what the page's state is, as functions: range() { from, to },
// intraday(), region(), fuel(), picked() (the units picked), newestDate(), shiftDate(date, n),
// and the names UNKNOWN and ROOFTOP.
// connect(data) is what runs these queries: the data source (../storage/data.js) wrapped by
// semantic/query.js, which turns a query into DAX and the DAX into SQL over the data's views.
